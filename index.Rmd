# Introduction

## Data Science Processes

A **data science process** includes:

1. data science workflow (e.g. CRISP-DM)
2. collaboration framework (e.g. Scrum)

The data science workflow provides the **what** and the collaboration framework provides the **how**.

## Collaboration Framework

The *focus* of this presentation is on collaboration frameworks. The three most popular collaboration frameworks are:

1. Scrum
2. Kanban
3. TDSP

## Collaboration Framework

**Kanban** is a simple collaboration framework for allocating tasks (e.g. CRISP-DM tasks) and monitoring project progression. This collaboration framework is covered in two parts:

1. Kanban Overview
2. Kanban + CRISP-DM

**Scrum** for software development and [Data Driven Scrum](https://datadrivenscrum.com) for data science are not covered. These frameworks could be too involved for NICD skills projects? 

# Kanban

## Kanban Overview

Kanban is "billboard" in Japanese. It is a **board** based collaboration framework commonly used in software development. It is based on two principles:

1. Visualise the Flow
2. Limit WIP

## Kanban Overview

![](figures/kanban-simple.png){width=60%}

A Kanban **board** contains **lists** (e.g. *To Do*, *Doing* and *Done*) that contain **tasks**. When a teams starts a task it is moved from the *To Do* list to the *Doing* list and when a team completes a task it is moved from the *Doing* list to the *Done* list.

## Kanban Overview

![](figures/kanban-simple.png){width=60%}

- Uncompleted tasks are known as **work in progress** (WIP)
- WIP limits are the maximum number of uncompleted tasks

## Kanban Validation List

A Kanban *Validation* list is after the *Doing* list and before the *Done* list. Advantages:

- validating tasks generally improves the quality of the tasks completed and the project
- a task done by one team member can be validated by another. This could help distribute skills across the team
- a task done by one or more team members can be validated by NICD. This could help identify learning opportunities

## Kanban and CRISP-DM

![](figures/kanban-trello.png){width=90%}

Tasks on the Kanban board can be tagged with the CRISP-DM **phase** (e.g. data preparation) they correspond to. This can help in communicating the progress of the project.

## Kanban and CRISP-DM

Waterfall approach delivers the features simultaneously:

## Kanban and CRISP-DM

Agile approach delivers the features sequentially:

## Kanban Benefits

- **Improves Communication**: highly visual and simple board, lists and flow of tasks
- **Enables Agility**: limits WIP to reduce time on uncompleted tasks and enables reprioritisation
- **No Time Box**: tasks do not require an estimation of time to completion
- **Adaptable**: no defined roles, meetings and artefacts so easy to integrate

## Sessions

Kanban could be enhanced by defining and referencing some project sessions. 

1. project kick-off sessions
2. skills transfer sessions
    - broad structure
    - no organisation managers
    - NICD members $\leq$ organisation members
3. preparation sessions
4. project review sessions
    - narrow structure
    - no limits on NICD or organisation members

## Kanban + Sessions

- **Time?** Only add tasks to the *To Do* list that can be complete within the time between skills transfer sessions. Validation of these tasks could be done during preparation sessions.
- **Sessions?** Skills transfer sessions every one or two weeks could be supplemented with a project review session after each phase is complete? 
- **Roles?** One team member could be given the responsibility to lead between skills transfer sessions?

# Plan

## Plan

With the time I have left:

1. start writing the NICD process guide:
    - project template (clean, wrangle and model)
    - data science workflow (e.g. CRISP-DM, task advice)
    - collaboration framework (e.g. Kanban, roles, sessions)
2. complete the project kick-off presentations
3. improve project template
    - Python and R template scripts
    - option to generate virtualenv
